#+title: Syntax Specification
#+date: 2024-09-14

* Types
- Signed integers: ~i8, i16, i32, i64~
- Unsigned integers: ~u8, u16, u32, u64~
- Pointers: ~*type~
- Arrays: ~[]type~

* Syntax
** Import
Each file is its own individual module. For example, a file located in *std/math* would be
imported as ~import std.math~

#+begin_src
  import module.path
#+end_src


** Expressions
- Literals: ~5~, ~3.14~, ~"hello world"~
- Array literal: ~[1, 2, 3]~
- Binary and unary expression: ~1 + 2~, ~-1~
- Function calls: ~max(1, 2)~

Some expressions can be used as statements (function calls and assignments)

** Statements
*** If statement
#+begin_src
  if cond then
     block
  end

  if cond then
     then_block
  else
     else_block
  end
#+end_src

Representation as EBNF
#+begin_src bnf
  block = stmt*;

  if_cond = expr;
  if_stmt = "if" if_cond "then" block ("else" block)? "end";
#+end_src

*** For and while loops
#+begin_src
  for i = 0, 10 do
      block
  end

  while counter < 10 do
      block
  end
#+end_src

Representation as EBNF
#+begin_src bnf
  block = stmt*;
  for_init = ident "=" expr;
  for_loop = "for" for_init "," expr "do" block "end";

  while_loop = "while" expr "do" block "end";
#+end_src
